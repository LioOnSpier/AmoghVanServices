        <p>As a parent, ensuring your child's safety during their daily commute to school is paramount. Here are essential safety tips to help prepare your child for safe school bus transportation.</p>
        
        <h2>Before the Bus Arrives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Teach your child to wait for the bus in a safe location, away from traffic</li>
          <li>Arrive at the bus stop 5 minutes early</li>
          <li>Stay back at least 6 feet from the curb</li>
          <li>Never let young children wait alone</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting On and Off the Bus</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wait until the bus comes to a complete stop</li>
          <li>Use handrails when boarding</li>
          <li>Take a seat immediately</li>
          <li>Exit carefully and move away from the bus quickly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>On the Bus</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay seated at all times</li>
          <li>Keep aisles clear of bags and feet</li>
          <li>Follow the driver's instructions</li>
          <li>Use quiet voices to avoid distracting the driver</li>
        </ul>
